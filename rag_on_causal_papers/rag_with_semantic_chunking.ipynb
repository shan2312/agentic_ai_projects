We do hope that \\nthe accruing benefits will flow in FY20 in the form of \\nimproved productivity, lower sales returns, higher FCF \\ngeneration and lower costs which will improve the \\nbottom line of the company. Further, with a very strong \\nand well established brand equity built over the last \\nseven decades I am confident we are strongly positioned \\nto benefit from the growth in the Education sector in \\nthe coming years.\\nThe draft of the New Education Policy 2019 announced \\npost the new government taking office is encouraging. \\nThe draft talks about release of the New Curriculum \\nFramework by the end of 2020 which will benefit us \\nfrom FY 21 onwards through the sale of new curriculum \\nbooks. Your Company being a leader in this space \\nwith strong in-house content development teams will \\nbenefit significantly. Since the new curriculum is being \\ndeveloped after a period of 15 years, it will eliminate \\nthe second-hand book market in the initial years and \\nlead to very strong topline growth for at least 2-3 years.\\nOur focus right now is to increase the business cash \\nflows. For the last 5-6 years, we were on a growth and \\nacquisition path. During the year, we also acquired the \\nremaining 26% stake in Chhaya Prakashini, thereby \\nincreasing our stake to a full 100%. Now we believe the \\ntime has come to focus on consolidating the business \\nand increasing our cash flows. This has been embedded \\nin the S Chand 3.0 initiative.\\nThe Economic Times projects that by 2025, India’s \\nGDP will be US$5 trillion making it the fastest growing \\neconomy in the world. Your company is well positioned \\nto benefit from the sector tailwinds. The Government \\nis promoting education through various schemes with \\nbudgetary support and an increasing number of students \\nare expected to enroll in private schools. We have \\nnoticed that there has been a progressive preference \\nfor private schools despite the benefits of subsidized \\nfees, free books and meals in the government schools. \\nFurther, CBSE and ICSE schools are preferred for their \\nsuperior curriculum and better pedagogy. We believe \\nthat S. Chand will be a key beneficiary of this trend, \\nbeing the leading content provider to these schools \\namongst the private publishers.\\nThe emergence of the private education market is \\ntypically led by the K-12 segment which has always been \\nour stronghold. Gross enrolment ratio and students \\ncompleting primary & secondary education has shown \\na gradual but definite improvement in India. Drop-out \\nrates have fallen and there is marked participation of girls \\nin education. These factors have led to an improvement \\nin India’s literacy rate – a signal that ‘Billion’ dollar \\nenterprises in the education industry will surely become \\na reality in the country. We are confident that S Chand \\nwill be there to ride that wave.\\nI would like to emphatically stress that we would not have \\nbeen be able to achieve any of the goals set out if not \\nfor the great human resource team in your company. An \\norganization is only as good as its people. And we have \\nsome of the best in the industry where every individual \\nis dedicated to serve the interests of the Company and is \\nnow committed to driving the 3.0 program successfully. \\nI thank them wholeheartedly for their dedication and \\ncontribution. And in equal measure, I thank our authors \\nwithout whose expertise and support we could not have \\nbeen a leader in the industry.\\nAnd finally, I have to thank our Board members and \\nshareholders for their unwavering faith and trust in our \\njourney.

Economic times projects per \\ncapita GDP of India to be ~ US$ 3,600 by 2025. The \\nemergence of the private education market is led by \\nthe K-12 segment, where your Company is strong and \\ndeep seated. The Government schools are losing favor \\neven amongst the rural and not so affluent populations \\nwhile the student share of private schools is consistently \\nincreasing. Your Company will be a key beneficiary of \\nthis trend as it is the leading content provider among \\nprivate publishers to CBSE and ICSE and unaffiliated \\nprivate schools which are emerging as the preferred \\nstudent choice. The number of schools in this target \\nmarket is growing by 8 to 10% annually and we are \\ncurrently covering over 38000 schools. I see a huge \\npotential here.\\nYour Company enjoys the trust of the consumer \\nbecause it has the pulse on their needs and is deeply \\ncommitted to meeting their requirements. This is made \\npossible by the dedication and superior skills of the \\npeople of S Chand – a day-to-day living of a deeply \\nembedded culture that is approximately 80 years old.

Revenues during the year took a major hit in anticipation of the new \\neducation policy which led to higher sales return from our channel partners. Incremental one-off provisioning and the Company’s conscious \\ndecision to work with better channel partners, coupled with other external headwinds including NCERT books being adopted by private schools \\nin some areas and guidance to reduce the weight of school bag, which also had an impact on the Revenues. However, later the Company has \\nintroduced Monthly Text Books (MTBs) to mitigate this.\\nDuring the year under review, your Company was more focused on improving operational efficiencies. The Company started with S Chand \\n3.0 program. This measure will lead to improved cash flow metrics in the next financial year by improving the velocity of collections, focusing \\non faster moving titles and higher margin products, reducing inventory and receivable levels, consolidating offices and warehouses, and re-\\nnegotiating major operational cost items. The Company is targeting annual cost savings in the range of Rs. 600 millions to Rs. 800.00 millions \\n(annualized basis) from the implementation of this program and has already taken substantial steps in this regard. Further, the Company is also \\nsetting up its own printing facilities in Sahibabad to further reduce cost of production and improve customer service.'),\n",

A system exists for seeking and obtaining further information and clarifications on the agenda items \\nbefore the meeting and for meaningful participation at the meeting;\\niii. All the decisions at the Board Meetings and Committee meetings were carried through with requisite majority as recorded in the minutes \\nof the meetings of the Board of Directors or Committees of the Board, as the case may be. The dissenting members’ views, if any, were \\ncaptured and recorded as part of the minutes.\\niv.

This in itself provides an optimistic picture for potential high growth in this sector.\\nThe education sector in India was estimated at US$91.7 billion in 2018 and is expected to reach US$101.1 billion by 2019.India has over 250 \\nmillion school going students - more than any other country in the world. A huge demand supply gap arising out of an additional requirement of \\n200,000 schools, 35,000 colleges, 700 universities and 40 million seats in vocational training centres will create manifold opportunities for the \\nexpansion and future growth of the education sector.\\nThe Government of India is targeting a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of 30 per cent for higher education by 2020 and is expected to drive \\ninvestments of US$200 billion in the education space during that time. The government is also planning to promote the education sector to help \\nincrease the share of overall services sector in the GDP of the country.\\nWith the increasing use of device based learning and increasing internet penetration, the importance of digital education and related learning \\ntools is irrefutable. As of December 2018, internet penetration in India had reached approximately 46% of the total population. Deepening internet \\npenetration will ensure consistent growth in the digital learning segment in terms of size and importance. As per a KPMG report, India has become \\nthe second largest market for e-learning after the US. The sector is expected to reach US$2 billion by 2021 with around 9.5 million users.\\nThe Education sector in India continues to be a strategic priority of the government. The Government of India has allowed 100 per cent Foreign \\nDirect Investment (FDI) in the education sector through the automatic route since 2002.The sector has received cumulative FDI worth US$2.2 \\nbillion up to December 2018. It witnessed 18 merger and acquisition deals worth US$49 million in 2017.3,500 of all the start-ups in India are in \\nthe education space and received close to US$700 million funding in 2018.\\nEducation being regarded as an important pillar in the growth of our economy, the Government has come up with significant reforms and \\nchanges in the New Education Policy.

The Company has a very seasonal business on \\naccount of K-12 segment, which accounts for more than 80% of the business. 80-85% of the annual revenues come just in the fourth quarter. \\nThis year when we entered the sales season, we were impacted by the anticipation of the announcement of the New Education Policy (NEP) \\nwhich was however deferred till after the elections. This led to the following challenges:\\n1. expectation of the education p olicy impacts Financial Year 2019 sales.\\nThe Honourable Education Minister of the 2014-19 NDA government, Mr Prakash Javdekar,gave the impression during various media \\ninteractions that the Education Policy was ready to be announced. The expectation of the industry is that when the new government is \\nformed, the New Education Policy would be one of the early initiatives on their agenda.

Since the Channel Partners perceived the announcement of the new education policy \\nas an event which would happen within CY2019, they destocked during the current fiscal assuming that the inventory they were holding \\nmay become obsolete and result in higher returns to the Company, over and above historical averages.\\n•\\u2002 Reduction in Sales Velocity. Further, in the current season in order to tackle future inventory levels on the back of the proposed New \\nEducation Policy announcement, the Company and channel partners took cognizance of inventory that would remain from the current sales \\nseason. Keeping this in mind, the Company also ensured that the channel inventory was kept lower during the current academic season.\\n2. the Company has taken a conscious decision to work with preferred channel partners.\\nAs in any distribution network, the Company had some channel partners who would fall short on the parameters of timely payment, returns \\nand overall revenue growth. During the current season of January-March, 2019, the Company had taken steps to reduce exposure or hold \\nsupplies to certain of these partners. This has also contributed to an impact on revenues which the Company is confident it would regain \\nthrough the preferred partners during the next academic session.\\n3. external factors impact sales.\\nThe industry also faced headwinds on account of various circulars/notices issued to private schools which compelled them to prescribe \\nNCERT books and in order to reduce the weight of the school bag, to lower the number of subjects being taught. The uncertainty and media \\nstories impacted and delayed decision making by schools about prescribing books. The Company has encountered similar experiences \\nby the introduction of monthly/semester books, digital products and value-added services like workshops and seminars to enhance \\nengagement with schools.\\n•\\u2002 Monthly/semester books are books created with content relevant to a specific month/semester rather than the whole year which helps \\nreduce the bag weight of a child. This can be done for a subject or for all subjects for the term.\\n•\\u2002 We are also part of the Federation for the Publishing Industry which has represented against these various circulars/practices in the \\nappropriate courts/forums.\\n4. reported revenues impacted by provisioning.\\nIn our view, Financial Year 2019 reported Revenues of Rs. 5,220 million have been impacted by -:\\n•\\u2002 Higher incremental provisioning of Rs 682 million on the back of a conservative view in light of the trends seen in the year ending March \\n2019 and the New Education policy. In our opinion, the incremental provision will be non-recurring.\\n•\\u2002 40% higher level of sales return received on a YoY basis by the channel on the back of an expectation of the New Education Policy.\\nWe would like to highlight that the reported net revenues gives a distorted view of the sales season since our gross sales dispatches were \\ndown by ~16% in the K-12 Academic season for Financial Year 2019 vs. Reported Net sales down by 34%. The reduction in channel inventory, \\npreferred partner sales, focus on high margin stock keeping units (SKU’s) and improvement in productivity will help retain revenues and \\nmargins in the near future.\\nFINaNCIaL  perF orMaNCe\\nFor the year under review, S Chand reported consolidated total income of Rs 5,336 million as against Rs 8,070 million in the comparable period \\nof the previous year, registering a decrease of 34% Y-o-Y. Our income was hit due to the higher sales return from our channel partners in \\nanticipation of the draft of New Education Policy (NEP), one time higher incremental provisioning, our strategy to work with preferred channel \\npartners, and other external headwinds like circulars from state governments on reducing bag weight for students, pressure for adoption of \\nNCERT books and reduction of certain noncore subjects in junior classes etc.\\nThe K-12 segment is the largest revenue contributor (~80% of the total revenues) followed by Higher education, early learning and digital. The \\nCompany reported consolidated EBITDA loss of Rs 195 million against EBITDA profit of Rs 2,054 million in the previous year and consolidated \\npost tax loss (net of minority interest and share of loss in associate companies) of Rs 644 million against profit of Rs.1,072 million in the same \\nperiod last year.

Focus on improving internal efficiency and reducing operational costs.`\\nWe have turned our focus on eliminating inefficiencies from our business. This would include working on improving the efficiency and \\nproductivity of our sales force and delivery teams, eliminating non-core projects and investing in technology to improve decision making. Various \\nsteps are being taken on this front including the rationalization of the number of offices and warehousing space across India, rationalisation \\nof payroll through consolidation of shared services, improving revenue per MT of paper consumed and increasing consumer engagement \\nthrough digital marketing and products. The Company is targeting annual cost savings in the range of Rs 600 million\\xa0 –\\xa0 Rs\\xa0 800\\xa0 million \\nfrom\\xa0these steps.\\n2. Increased focus on free cash flow generation for Financial Year 2020.\\nThe Company has announced that it will enhance focus on improving free cash flows from operations. This strategy of focusing on cash \\nflows has started yielding results with cash generated from operations of Rs 386 million in Financial Year 2019 (vs. Rs 390 million in \\nFinancial Year 2018). This is despite the 34% drop in net revenues for the year. We are looking to increase this by focusing on inventory \\nreduction going ahead, improving the collection of receivables and reducing costs in our system. We are targeting a higher conversion of \\nEBITDA to free cash flow in excess of 50% in the future.\\n3. Benefit from New Education Policy to flow though from Financial Year 2021 onwards.\\nWhile there has been an impact on revenues in the current financial year from multiple factors discussed earlier, a New Education Policy \\nis normally followed by a change in curriculum which is greatly beneficial to the Company and sector as it removes piracy and used book \\ncirculation. This helps publishers by netting higher than normal volumes for multiple years. This phenomenon has been noted consistently \\nwith State curriculum changes and we expect to derive benefit from the same in due course of time.\\n4. Increase in share of Digital & Services business.\\nThe Company has forayed into various other products and services in the past few years to build alternate product and service lines. Some \\nof the initiatives have gained traction - Destination Success, Mylestone, Smart K, Test Coach and Risekids, have all carved a niche segment \\nin the markets in which they operate. This will help the Company spread revenue through the first three quarters, enhance visibility and \\nde-risk the present business model.\\nTo augment books the Company has also rolled out the App Mystudygear (approximately 0.5 million downloads) for ensuring the books of the \\nCompany offer a blended learning solution in the form of Digitally Enabled Books (i.e DEBs). The Company recognises the need of the Gen X \\nstudent to learn on various media not limited to printed books, but augmented by Interactive Videos, Test Generators, Online Assessments \\nand Analytics, Virtual Reality and Games. Almost 2/3 of the titles in the K-12 segment are DEBs which enable this 360 degree learning. The \\nCompany is also geared to launch its all-in-one learning platform Learnflix in Financial Year 2020. This will enable a larger audience to \\nlearn on the move.\\n5. Going ahead.\\nWith our increased focus on free cash flow generation, going ahead the Company has an ambitious target of turning debt free in the next \\nthree years and increasing EBITDA to free cash flow conversion rate to over 50%. We see ourselves well positioned to benefit from the New \\nEducation Policy which has been announced which should lead to a period of strong & sustainable growth in the medium term.'),\n",

However, we foresee a scenario where a huge part of the industry would not be able to deliver content \\npertaining to the new curriculum in Academic year 2021-22 due to the paucity of time for developing and publishing new content. Thus, there \\ncan be a situation where a lot of schools would be able to adopt the new framework books from Academic year 2022-23 onwards.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of \\nthe Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements’ section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis \\nfor our audit opinion on the standalone Ind AS financial statements.\\nKey Audit Matters\\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial \\nstatements for the financial year ended March 31, 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone Ind AS \\nfinancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter \\nbelow, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context. \\nWe have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We have fulfilled the \\nresponsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements section of our report, \\nincluding in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of \\nthe risks of material misstatement of the standalone Ind AS financial statements.

Management \\nreviewed regularly whether there are any indicators of impairment of \\nthe investments. Impairment indicators were observed on the loans and \\ninvestments in DS Digital and Safari Digital. As a result, an impairment \\nassessment was required to be performed by comparing the carrying \\nvalue of these subsidiaries to their recoverable amount to determine \\nwhether an impairment was required to be recognized.\\nOur audit procedures performed included the following:\\n•\\t Assessment\\t of\\tthe\\treport\\tproduced\\tby\\tthe\\tthird-party\\tspecialists,\\t\\nas well as the assessment of their competence and objectivity; \\n \\nwe also assessed the Company’s valuation methodology \\napplied in determining the recoverable amount, the \\nassumptions around the key drivers of the cash flow forecasts \\nwith reference to expected growth rates.'),\n",

In assessing the recoverability, \\nmanagement exercised judgements to evaluate the collectability \\nconsidering whether DS Digital and Safari Digital have financial \\ndifficulties, in repaying the loans.\\nFor investments where impairment indicators exist, management \\nestimated the recoverable amounts of the investments, being higher of \\nfair value less costs of disposal and value in use. The value in use of the \\nunderlying businesses is determined based on the discounted cash flow \\nprojections. The recoverable amount was determined in accordance \\nwith Ind AS 36 Impairment of Assets to be the higher of the fair value \\nless cost of disposal, and the value in use, determined by discounting \\nfuture cash flows. \\nThe processes and methodologies for assessing and determining \\nthe recoverable amount are based on management’ judgment, with \\nreference to the identification of impairment indicators, to forecast of \\nfuture cash flows, the normalized cash flows assumed as a basis for \\nthe\\tterminal\\tvalue,\\tas\\twell\\tas\\tthe\\tlong-term\\tgrowth\\trates\\tand\\tdiscount\\t\\nrates applied to such cash flows forecasts.\\nApart from regularly assessing the impairment indicators as mentioned \\nabove, during the year ended Mar’18, the Company had filed a scheme \\nwith SEBI, for merger of education business of both Safari Digital and DS \\nDigital.

The specific recognition criteria \\ndescribed below must also be met before revenue is recognised..\\nThe specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised.\\nSale of goods\\nRevenue from sale of books is recognised at the point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the customer, i.e. at the time of handing \\nover goods to the carrier for transportation.\\nThe Company considers whether there are other promises in the contract that are separate performance obligations to which a portion of the \\ntransaction price needs to be allocated. In determining the transaction price for the sale of books, the Company considers the effects of variable \\nconsideration,\\tthe\\texistence\\tof\\tsignificant\\tfinancing\\tcomponents,\\tnon-cash\\tconsideration,\\tand\\tconsideration\\tpayable\\tto\\tthe\\tcustomer\\t(if\\tany).\\nThe provision for anticipated returns is made primarily on the basis of historical return rates. The provision for turnover discount, cash discount& \\nadditional discount is made on estimated basis based on historical trends.\\nVariable consideration\\nIf the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, the Company estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled \\nin exchange for transferring the goods to the customer. The variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and constrained until \\nit is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated \\nuncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Some of the contracts with customer provide a right to customer of cash \\nrebate/discount if payment is cleared within specified due dates.\\n•\\t Rights\\tof\\treturn\\nCertain contracts provide a customer with a right to return the goods within a specified period. The provision for anticipated returns is made \\nprimarily on the basis of historical return rates as this method best predicts the amount of variable consideration to which the Company \\nwill be entitled. The requirements in Ind AS 115 on constraining estimates of variable consideration are also applied in order to determine \\nthe amount of variable consideration that can be included in the transaction price.\\n•\\t Volume\\trebates\\nThe Company provides volume rebates to certain customers once the valueof products purchased during the period exceeds a threshold \\nspecified in the contract. Rebates are offset against amounts payable by the customer. To estimate the variable consideration for the expected \\nfuture\\trebates,\\tthe\\tCompany\\tapplies\\tthe\\tmost\\tlikely\\tamount\\tmethod\\tfor\\tcontracts\\twith\\ta\\tsingle-volume\\t threshold\\tand\\tthe\\texpected\\tvalue\\t\\nmethod for contracts with more than one volume threshold. The selected method that best predicts the amount of variable consideration is \\nprimarily driven by the number of volume thresholds contained in the contract. The Company then applies the requirements on constraining \\nestimates of variable consideration and recognises a refund liability for the expected future rebates.\\n•\\t Cash\\trebates\\nThe Company provides cash rebates to certain customers if customers make the payment within the stipulated time given in the contract. \\nThe provision for cash discount is made on estimated basis based on historical trends. The Company then applies the requirements on \\nconstraining estimates of variable consideration and recognises a refund liability for the expected future rebates.\\nContract assets\\nA contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the Company performs by \\ntransferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognised \\nfor the earned consideration that is conditional.\\nTrade receivables\\nA receivable represents the Company’s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before \\npayment of the consideration is due).'),\n",

If a customer pays consideration before the Company transfers goods or services to the customer, \\na contract liability is recognised when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are recognised as \\nrevenue when the Company performs under the contract.\\nInterest income\\nInterest income is recognized on time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the rate applicablefor all financial \\ninstruments\\tmeasured\\tat\\tamortised\\tcost\\tand\\tother\\tinterest-bearing\\tfinancial\\tassets,\\tinterest\\tincome\\tis\\trecorded\\tusing\\tthe\\teffective\\tinterest\\trate\\t\\n(EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, \\nwhere appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Company estimates the \\nexpected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar \\noptions) but does not consider the expected credit losses. Interest income is included in other income in the statement of profit or loss.\\nDividends\\nDividend Income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when shareholders approve \\nthe dividend.\\nCross Charges for Shared Services\\nThe company provides various administrative and management services through shared resources to its subsidiary companies to facilitate \\nday to day operations. The company recognises revenue over time, because the subsidiaries receive and consume the service provided by the \\ncompany over that period.\\nInd AS 115 adoption\\nInd AS 115 supersedes Ind AS 18 Revenue and it applies, with limited exceptions, to all revenue arising from contracts with customers. Ind AS \\n115\\testablishes\\ta\\tfive-step\\tmodel\\tto\\taccount\\tfor\\trevenue\\tarising\\tfrom\\tcontracts\\twith\\tcustomers\\tand\\trequires\\tthat\\trevenue\\tbe\\trecognised\\tat\\tan\\t\\namount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.\\nInd AS 115 requires entities to exercise judgement, taking into consideration all of the relevant facts and circumstances when applying each step \\nof the model to contracts with their customers. The standard also specifies the accounting for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract and \\nthe costs directly related to fulfilling a contract. In addition, the standard requires extensive disclosures.\\nThe company adopted Ind AS 115 using the modified retrospective method of adoption with the date of initial application of 1 April 2018. Under this \\nmethod, the standard can be applied either to all contracts at the date of initial application or only to contracts that are not completed at this date. \\nThe standard is applied retrospectively only to contracts that are not completed as at the date of initial application and comparative information \\nis not restated in the financial statements. Further there were no adjustments required to the retained earnings at April 1, 2018. The adoption of \\nthe standard did not have any material impact on the recognition and measurement of revenue and related items in the financial results.\\n2.6 Income taxes\\nCurrent income tax\\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities in accordance \\nwith the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted \\nat the reporting date in the countries where the Company operates and generates taxable income.\\nCurrent income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income \\nor in equity). Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management \\nperiodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation \\nand establishes provisions where appropriate.\\nDeferred tax\\nDeferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying \\namounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.\\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:\\n•\\t \\tWhen\\tthe\\tdeferred\\ttax\\tliability\\tarises\\tfrom\\tthe\\tinitial\\trecognition\\tof\\tgoodwill\\tor\\tan\\tasset\\tor\\tliability\\tin\\ta\\ttransaction\\t that\\tis\\tnot\\ta\\tbusiness\\t\\ncombination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss\\n•\\t \\tIn\\trespect\\tof\\ttaxable\\ttemporary\\tdifferences\\tassociated\\twith\\tinvestments\\tin\\tsubsidiaries\\t and\\tassociates,\\twhen\\tthe\\ttiming\\tof\\tthe\\treversal\\tof\\t\\nthe temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.'),\n",

As such, Indian GAAP balances relating to business combinations entered into before that date, \\nincluding goodwill, have been carried forward with no adjustments. (Refer Note 4).\\nRecognition and measurement\\nIntangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination \\nis their fair value as at the date of acquisition.

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life \\nare reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future \\neconomic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as \\nchanges in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the statement of profit or loss \\nin the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible assets.\\nIntangible\\t assets\\t with\\tindefinite\\t useful\\t lives\\tare\\tnot\\tamortised,\\t but\\tare\\ttested\\t for\\timpairment\\t annually,\\teither\\t individually\\t or\\tat\\tthe\\tcash-\\ngenerating unit level.

After initial recognition, no reclassification is made \\nfor financial assets which are equity instruments and financial liabilities. For financial assets which are debt instruments, a reclassification is \\nmade only if there is a change in the business model for managing those assets. Changes to the business model are expected to be infrequent. \\nThe Company’s senior management determines change in the business model as a result of external or internal changes which are significant \\nto the Company’s operations. Such changes are evident to external parties. A change in the business model occurs when the Company \\neither begins or ceases to perform an activity that is significant to its operations. If the Company reclassifies financial assets, it applies the \\nreclassification prospectively from the reclassification date which is the first day of the immediately next reporting period following the change \\nin business model. The Company does not restate any previously recognised gains, losses (including impairment gains or losses) or interest.\\nOffsetting of Financial Instruments\\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the unconsolidated balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable \\nlegal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\\n2.14 Retirement and other employee benefits\\nRetirement benefit in the form of provident fund is a defined contribution scheme. The Company has no obligation, other than the contribution \\npayable to the provident fund. The Company recognizes contribution payable to the provident fund scheme as an expense, when an employee \\nrenders the related service. If the contribution payable to the scheme for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution \\nalready paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognized as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. If the contribution \\nalready paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the balance sheet date, then excess is recognized as an asset to the \\nextent\\tthat\\tthe\\tpre-payment\\twill\\tlead\\tto,\\tfor\\texample,\\ta\\treduction\\tin\\tfuture\\tpayment\\tor\\ta\\tcash\\trefund.\\nThe Company operates a defined benefit gratuity plan in India, which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered fund.\\nThe cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plan is determined using the projected unit credit method.\\nRe-measurements,\\t comprising\\tof\\tactuarial\\tgains\\tand\\tlosses,\\tthe\\teffect\\tof\\tthe\\tasset\\tceiling,\\texcluding\\tamounts\\tincluded\\tin\\tnet\\tinterest\\ton\\tthe\\t\\nnet defined benefit liability and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability), are \\nrecognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they \\noccur.\\tRe-measurements\\tare\\tnot\\treclassified\\tto\\tprofit\\tor\\tloss\\tin\\tsubsequent\\tperiods.\\nPast service costs are recognised in profit or loss on the earlier of:\\n•\\t The\\tdate\\tof\\tthe\\tplan\\tamendment\\tor\\tcurtailment,\\tand\\n•\\t The\\tdate\\tthat\\tthe\\tCompany\\trecognises\\trelated\\trestructuring\\tcosts\\nNet interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.

The management believes that the estimates used in preparation of the financial statements are \\nprudent and reasonable. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to \\nthe carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.\\nA. Judgement\\nIn the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the most significant \\neffect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:\\nOperating lease commitments - Company as a lessee\\nThe Company has entered into lease agreements with lessor and has determined, based on an evaluation of the terms and conditions of the \\narrangements, such as the lease term not constituting a major part of the economic life of the commercial property and the fair value of the asset, \\nthat it does not retains the significant risks and rewards of ownership of these properties and accounts for the contracts as operating leases.\\nRevenue from contracts with customers\\nThe Company applied the following judgements that significantly affect the determination of the amount and timing of revenue from contracts \\nwith customers:\\nDetermining method to estimate variable consideration and assessing the constraint\\nCertain contracts for the sale of books include cash rebates and volume rebates and a right to return the goods that give rise to variable \\nconsideration. In estimating the variable consideration, the Company is required to use either the expected value method or the most likely \\namount method based on which method better predicts the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled.\\nThe most likely amount method is used for those contracts with a single volume threshold, while the expected value method is used for \\ncontracts with more than one volume threshold.\\nBefore including any amount of variable consideration in the transaction price, the Company considers whether the amount of variable \\nconsideration is constrained. The Company determined that the estimates of variable consideration are not constrained based on its historical \\nexperience, business forecast and the current economic conditions. In addition, the uncertainty on the variable consideration will be resolved \\nwithin a short time frame.\\nB. Estimates and assumptions\\nThe key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk \\nof causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The \\nCompany based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances \\nand assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control \\nof the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an \\nongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised prospectively.'),\n",

All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\\nThe parameter most subject to change is the discount rate. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the management considers the \\ninterest rates of government bonds with term that correspond with the expected term of the defined benefit obligation.\\nThe mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables. Those mortality tables tend to change only at interval in response to \\ndemographic changes. Future salary increases and gratuity increases are based on expected future inflation rates for the respective countries.\\nFurther details about gratuity obligations are given in Note 33.\\nProvision for trade receivable\\nTrade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable \\namounts.\\tEstimated\\tirrecoverable\\tamounts\\tare\\tbased\\ton\\tthe\\tageing\\tof\\tthe\\treceivable\\tbalances\\tand\\thistorical\\texperience\\tadjusted\\tfor\\tforward-\\nlooking estimates.

Reasonable assurance is a high level \\nof assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. \\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected \\nto influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated Ind AS financial statements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.

Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or \\nconditions may cause the Group and its associates to cease to continue as a going concern. \\n•\\t Evaluate\\t the\\toverall\\tpresentation,\\t structure\\tand\\tcontent\\tof\\tthe\\tconsolidated\\t Ind\\tAS\\tfinancial\\tstatements,\\t including\\t the\\tdisclosures,\\t and\\t\\nwhether the consolidated Ind AS financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair \\npresentation. \\n•\\t Obtain\\t sufficient\\t appropriate\\t audit\\t evidence\\t regarding\\t the\\tfinancial\\t information\\t of\\tthe\\tentities\\t or\\tbusiness\\t activities\\t within\\t the\\tGroup\\t\\nand its associates of which we are the independent auditors, to express an opinion on the consolidated Ind AS financial statements. \\nWe are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included \\nin the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors.

The specific recognition criteria \\ndescribed below must also be met before revenue is recognised.\\nThe specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised.\\nSale of goods\\nRevenue from sale of books is recognised at the point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the customer, i.e. at the time of handing \\nover goods to the carrier for transportation. \\nThe Company considers whether there are other promises in the contract that are separate performance obligations to which a portion of the \\ntransaction price needs to be allocated. In determining the transaction price for the sale of books, the Company considers the effects of variable \\nconsideration,\\tthe\\texistence\\tof\\tsignificant\\tfinancing\\tcomponents,\\tnon-cash\\tconsideration,\\tand\\tconsideration\\tpayable\\tto\\tthe\\tcustomer\\t(if\\tany).\\nThe provision for anticipated returns is made primarily on the basis of historical return rates. The provision for turnover discount, cash discount \\n& additional discount is made on estimated basis based on historical trends.\\nVariable consideration\\nIf the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, the Company estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled \\nin exchange for transferring the goods to the customer. The variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and constrained until \\nit is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated \\nuncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Some of the contracts with customer provide a right to customer of cash \\nrebate/discount if payment is cleared within specified due dates.\\n•\\t Rights\\tof\\treturn\\nCertain contracts provide a customer with a right to return the goods within a specified period. The provision for anticipated returns is made \\nprimarily on the basis of historical return rates as this method best predicts the amount of variable consideration to which the Company \\nwill be entitled. The requirements in Ind AS 115 on constraining estimates of variable consideration are also applied in order to determine \\nthe amount of variable consideration that can be included in the transaction price. \\n•\\t Volume\\trebates\\nThe Company provides volume rebates to certain customers once the value of products purchased during the period exceeds a threshold \\nspecified in the contract. Rebates are offset against amounts payable by the customer.

EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash receipts over the expected \\nlife of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset. When \\ncalculating the effective interest rate, the Company estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms \\nof the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) but does not consider the expected \\ncredit losses. Interest income is included in other income in the statement of profit or loss.\\nDividends\\nDividend Income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when shareholders approve \\nthe dividend.\\nInd AS 115 adoption\\nInd\\tAS\\t115\\tsupersedes\\tInd\\tAS\\t18\\tRevenue\\tand\\tit\\tapplies,\\twith\\tlimited\\texceptions,\\tto\\tall\\trevenue\\tarising\\tfrom\\tcontracts\\twith\\tcustomers.\\tInd\\tAS\\t\\n115\\testablishes\\ta\\tfive-step\\tmodel\\tto\\taccount\\tfor\\trevenue\\tarising\\tfrom\\tcontracts\\twith\\tcustomers\\tand\\trequires\\tthat\\trevenue\\tbe\\trecognised\\tat\\tan\\t\\namount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.\\nInd AS 115 requires entities to exercise judgement, taking into consideration all of the relevant facts and circumstances when applying each step \\nof the model to contracts with their customers.

Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. \\n2.11 Leases\\nThe determination of whether an arrangement is (or contains) a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception of the \\nlease. The arrangement is, or contains, a lease if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and the \\narrangement conveys a right to use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly specified in an arrangement.\\nGroup as a lessee\\nA lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or an operating lease.

If such indication exists, the group estimates the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable \\namount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s \\nrecoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not \\nexceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment \\nloss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the asset is carried at a \\nrevalued amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.\\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. \\nImpairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU (or group of CGUs) to which the goodwill relates. When \\nthe recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill \\ncannot be reversed in future periods.\\n2.14 Financial instruments\\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another \\nentity.\\nFinancial assets\\nInitial recognition and measurement\\nAll financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, \\ntransaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of \\nassets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, \\ni.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset\\nSubsequent measurement \\nFor purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:\\n•\\t Financial\\tassets\\tat\\tamortised\\tcost\\n•\\t Debt\\tinstruments\\tat\\tfair\\tvalue\\tthrough\\tother\\tcomprehensive\\tincome\\t(FVTOCI)'),\n",

Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the profit or loss. \\nFinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, \\nand\\tonly\\tif\\tthe\\tcriteria\\tin\\tInd-AS\\t109\\tare\\tsatisfied.\\tFor\\tliabilities\\t designated\\t as\\tFVTPL,\\tfair\\tvalue\\tgains/\\tlosses\\tattributable\\t to\\tchanges\\tin\\town\\t\\ncredit risk are recognized in OCI.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that \\nare an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally \\napplies to borrowings. \\nFinancial guarantee contracts\\nFinancial guarantee contracts issued by the group are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it \\nincurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee \\ncontracts are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the \\nguarantee.

After initial recognition, no reclassification is made \\nfor financial assets which are equity instruments and financial liabilities. For financial assets which are debt instruments, a reclassification is \\nmade only if there is a change in the business model for managing those assets. Changes to the business model are expected to be infrequent. \\nThe group’s senior management determines change in the business model as a result of external or internal changes which are significant \\nto the group’s operations. Such changes are evident to external parties. A change in the business model occurs when the group either begins \\nor ceases to perform an activity that is significant to its operations. If the group reclassifies financial assets, it applies the reclassification \\nprospectively from the reclassification date which is the first day of the immediately next reporting period following the change in business \\nmodel. The group does not restate any previously recognised gains, losses (including impairment gains or losses) or interest.\\nOffsetting of Financial Instruments \\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated balance sheet if there is a currently \\nenforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the \\nliabilities simultaneously.\\n2.15 Retirement and other employee benefits\\nRetirement benefit in the form of provident fund is a defined contribution scheme. The group has no obligation, other than the contribution \\npayable to the provident fund. The group recognizes contribution payable to the provident fund scheme as an expense, when an employee \\nrenders the related service. If the contribution payable to the scheme for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution \\nalready paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognized as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid.

The management believes that the estimates used in preparation of the financial statements are \\nprudent and reasonable. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to \\nthe carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.\\nA. Judgements\\nIn the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the most significant \\neffect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:\\nOperating lease commitments – Group as a lessee\\nThe Group has entered into lease agreements with lessor and has determined, based on an evaluation of the terms and conditions of the arrangements, \\nsuch as the lease term not constituting a major part of the economic life of the commercial property and the fair value of the asset, that it does not \\nretains the significant risks and rewards of ownership of these properties and accounts for the contracts as operating leases.\\nB. Estimates and assumptions\\nThe key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of \\ncausing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The Group \\nbased its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and \\nassumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of \\nthe Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing \\nbasis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised prospectively.\\nTaxes\\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the losses can be utilised. \\nSignificant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely \\ntiming and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.\\nDefined benefit plans (gratuity)\\nThe cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An \\nactuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination \\nof\\tthe\\tdiscount\\trate,\\tfuture\\tsalary\\tincreases\\tand\\tmortality\\trates.\\tDue\\tto\\tthe\\tcomplexities\\tinvolved\\tin\\tthe\\tvaluation\\tand\\tits\\tlong-term\\tnature,\\ta\\t\\ndefined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\\nThe parameter most subject to change is the discount rate. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the management considers the \\ninterest rates of government bonds with term that correspond with the expected term of the defined benefit obligation.\\nThe mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables. Those mortality tables tend to change only at interval in response to \\ndemographic changes. Future salary increases and gratuity increases are based on expected future inflation rates for the respective countries.\\nFurther details about gratuity obligations are given in Note 35.\\nProvision for trade receivable\\nTrade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable \\namounts.\\tEstimated\\tirrecoverable\\tamounts\\tare\\tbased\\ton\\tthe\\tageing\\tof\\tthe\\treceivable\\tbalances\\tand\\thistorical\\texperience\\tadjusted\\tfor\\tforward-\\nlooking estimates.

According to the appendix, companies need to determine the probability of the \\nrelevant tax authority accepting each tax treatment, or group of tax treatments, that the companies have used or plan to use in their income tax \\nfiling which has to be considered to compute the most likely amount or the expected value of the tax treatment when determining taxable profit \\n(tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates.'),\n",

Amendment to Ind AS 19: Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement\\nThe amendments to Ind AS 19 address the accounting when a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement occurs during a reporting period.

This amount is recognised in profit or loss.\\nAn entity then determines the effect of the asset ceiling after the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement. Any change in that effect, \\nexcluding amounts included in the net interest, is recognised in other comprehensive income.\\nThe amendments apply to plan amendments, curtailments, or settlements occurring on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting \\nperiod that begins on or after 1 April 2019. These amendments will apply only to any future plan amendments, curtailments, or settlements of \\nthe Company.\\ne. Amendment to Ind AS 109: Prepayment Feature with Negative Compensation\\nUnder Ind AS 109, a debt instrument can be measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, provided that \\nthe contractual cash flows are ‘solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding’ (the SPPI criterion) and the \\ninstrument is held within the appropriate business model for that classification. The amendments to Ind AS 109 clarify that a financial asset \\npasses the SPPI criterion regardless of the event or circumstance that causes the early termination of the contract and irrespective of which \\nparty pays or receives reasonable compensation for the early termination of the contract.\\nThe amendments should be applied retrospectively and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 April 2019. \\nThe Group is under the process of evaluation impact on the financial statements of the Group.\\nf.
